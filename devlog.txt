Started making the design doc and came up with ideas on how to expand the simple snake game into a full project. We decided on difficulty levels (map sizes, speeds) and 
different modes (obstacles, border wrapping, invincible)

noakaiA, qinaL -- 2022-3-6 22:16
finished up design doc; added roles and ideas, wrote frontend section, finished component map

qinaL -- 2022-03-07 18:46
- added heading to README.md 

noakaiA, qinaL -- 2022-3-7 21:13
Revised design doc based on in-class comments. There weren't too many, so it was just a sentance here or there

justinM, qinaL -- 2022-3-8 9:15
created working Flask app

ivanM, qinaL, justinM -- 2022-3-8 9:21
created requirements.txt

noakaiA -- 2022-3-8 9:22
created folders and files for later app ultility. Updated app to not include random unused functions

ivanM -- 2022-3-9 9:10
added team flag to repo

justinM, qinaL -- 2022-3-9 09:14
put stuff on home.html

noakaiA -- 2022-3-9 09:19
formatted home.html and added bootstrap to all pages

qinaL -- 2022-3-9 15:14
- created base.html and turned all html files created into jinja inheritance format with base.html as parent
- linked css and bootstrap 
- some site-wide css- font and text-align center 

noakaiA -- 2022-3-10 09:25
reformatted login and register pages to have form control classes

ivanM -- 2022-3-10 09:26
- added to leaderboard.html

noakaiA -- 2022-3-10 09:21
began snake game. Made a... board? It's not a checkerboard but it is something.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-11 09:27
Finished board. It's a checkerboard!

ivanM -- 2022-3-11 09:28
- added to settings.html

qinaL -- 2022-3-12 18:51
- got get_score() and add_score() in db.py to work (at least with current testcases)
    - test cases for these are in __init__.py commented out
- added a button for settings in home page (doesn't look good, someone (prolly Noakai) will fix that)

qinaL -- 2022-3-13 19:17
- add_score() improvement- replaced the search loop for username in db with sqlite SELECT EXISTS statement
- cleaned up some comments, db testcases from __init__.py to db.py

noakaiA -- 2022-3-12 18:19
Import problems with LinkedList class. How to get it work? QAF post is accumulating answers.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-13 11:57
Whatever, I just put all the classes into the same js file as the snake functions... it works, sort of. It's wayyyyy too fast.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-14 10: 58
Changed it to not use animation frames. It now uses a ticker function and moves at a normal speed.

ivanM -- 2022-3-15 9:27
- added more to settings.html and leaderboard.html

noakaiA -- 2022-3-15 11:00
Now the snake died when bonked by a wall. Cool

noakaiA -- 2022-3-15 19:01
Now the snake died when bonked by itself. Cool

qinaL -- 2020-3-15 20:30
- got form in settings.html to work and send data to /play, where each setting is added to session

noakaiA -- 2022-3-16 09:15
Removed glitch where you can change snake's direction twice and started on apples. Also, added comments to stuff.

ivanM -- 2022-3-16 9:18
- small changes to settings.html and leaderboard.html. Also started working on keeping the correct radio buttons checked in settings.

qinaL -- 2020-3-16 16:42
- leaderboard now displays data from db
    - top_n is changed to top_n_scores and top_n_users have been added 

qinaL -- 2020-3-16 17:11
- found issues with the getting the db data into leaderboard; fixed them
- combined top_n_scores and top_n_users into one function --> top_n; top_n returns a tuple of 2 lists
- NOTE: leaderboard is only a board for basic mode

noakaiA 2022-3-16 20:32
Added apples and growing. The game is finally pretty much done.

qinaL -- 2020-3-16 22:16
- planning on showing data in leaderboard with js so each mode can be shown on same page 
    - data from python has to be sent to js; working on how (something with JSON (jsonify added as import from flask) and fetch)
    - leaderboard.js was made to do js in leaderboard page; new function in init, leaderboard_data, used to send data to leaderboard.js
    - currently a scores and users array is able to be printed in console

noakaiA 2022-3-17 09:17
Fixed some major bugs. The snake does not randomly die when you get an apple, the apples cannot spawn within the snake and the mechanism
for spawning apples was streamlines so as to not include recursion.

qinaL -- 2022-3-17 9:20
- leaderboard now has a dropdown menu with an event listener that fetches data (hardcoded as basic for now) and prints the selected mode 

qinaL -- 2022-3-17 15:07
- the data inserted into leaderboard can now be adjusted with js
