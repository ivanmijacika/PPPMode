Started making the design doc and came up with ideas on how to expand the simple snake game into a full project. We decided on difficulty levels (map sizes, speeds) and 
different modes (obstacles, border wrapping, invincible)

noakaiA, qinaL -- 2022-3-6 22:16
finished up design doc; added roles and ideas, wrote frontend section, finished component map

noakaiA, qinaL -- 2022-3-7 21:13
Revised design doc based on in-class comments. There weren't too many, so it was just a sentance here or there

noakaiA -- 2022-3-10 09:21
began snake game. Made a... board? It's not a checkerboard but it is something.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-11 09:27
Finished board. It's a checkerboard!

ivanM -- 2022-3-11 09:28
- added to settings.html

qinaL -- 2022-3-12 18:51
- got get_score() and add_score() in db.py to work (at least with current testcases)
    - test cases for these are in __init__.py commented out
- added a button for settings in home page (doesn't look good, someone (prolly Noakai) will fix that)

qinaL -- 2022-3-13 19:17
- add_score() improvement- replaced the search loop for username in db with sqlite SELECT EXISTS statement
- cleaned up some comments, db testcases from __init__.py to db.py

noakaiA -- 2022-3-12 18:19
Import problems with LinkedList class. How to get it work? QAF post is accumulating answers.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-13 11:57
Whatever, I just put all the classes into the same js file as the snake functions... it works, sort of. It's wayyyyy too fast.

noakaiA -- 2022-3-14 10: 58
Changed it to not use animation frames. It now uses a ticker function and moves at a normal speed.

ivanM -- 2022-3-15 9:27
- added more to settings.html and leaderboard.html

noakaiA -- 2022-3-15 11:00
Now the snake died when bonked by a wall. Cool

noakaiA -- 2022-3-15 19:01
Now the snake died when bonked by itself. Cool

qinaL -- 2020-3-15 20:30
- got form in settings.html to work and send data to /play, where each setting is added to session

noakaiA -- 2022-3-16 09:15
Removed glitch where you can change snake's direction twice and started on apples. Also, added comments to stuff.
